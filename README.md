# licheszter
Licheszter is a Rust library that wraps the Lichess bot API. This library does not aim to cover the entire Lichess API, but rather only the parts required for creating a Lichess bot. If more of the API is covered in the future, they will be available through features that must be explicitly enabled.

**DISCLAIMER**: The code of this library was heavily influenced by the [licoricedev](https://crates.io/crates/licoricedev) crate. To respect the author(s) of `licoricedev`, this project comes with the same license (GNU AGPL v3.0).
